Introspect the random module, and particularly the randrange()
function it provides.  Use this module to write a "Flashcard"
function.  Your function should ask the user:

What is 9 times 3

where 9 and 3 are any numbers from 0 to 12, randomly chosen.

If the user gets the answer right, your function should say, "Right!"
and then return a 1.  If the answer is wrong, say "Almost, the right
answer is 27" and return a 0.

Write a function called Quiz(n) that calls your Flashcard function n
times and reports the percentage of right answers like this,
"Score is 90". It also returns this percentage.

Make another function called GiveFeedback(p) that receives a percentage,
0 - 100.  If p is 100 says,"Perfect!"; if it's 90-99, say "Excellent";
80-89, say "Very good"; 70-79, say "Good enough"; <= 69, "You need
more practice".

Test all that in your program, calling Quiz(10) and then pass the
returned value into GiveFeedback().

Make a new function called "Praise" that takes no arguments.  It
prints one of (at least) 5 phrases of Praise, chosen randomly.  It
might say, "Right On!", or "Good work!", for example.  Call this
Praise() function from your Flashcard() function whenever your user
gets the answer right.

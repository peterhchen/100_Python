
In my house we have 3 dogs who love to tease our old cat.  The old cat
gets quite bewildered when they take turns running in front of him and
getting in his way.  He steps around one dog, then the next dog, then
the next dog, just to find the first dog again in his way.  However,
at nap time, they all curl up together, 3 dogs and one old cat.
